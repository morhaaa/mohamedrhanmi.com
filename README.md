# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! Feel free to check out my live portfolio at https://www.mohamedrhanmi.com/. I hope my portfolio inspires you or provides insights for your personal project.
Here you'll find the source code for my portfolio website, built with Next.js v14. I drew inspiration from this fantastic GitHub project: [portfolio-website](https://github.com/ByteGrad/portfolio-website).

## Key Features

- **Next.js v14:** My portfolio has been developed using the latest version of Next.js, offering improved performance and new features.

- **Dark/Light Mode:** I provide a dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions. You can easily toggle between dark and light modes.

- **Language Switching:** The portfolio supports both Italian and English. You can easily switch the language through a simple selector.
